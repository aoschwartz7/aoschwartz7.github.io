  <span>Global prediction of unreported SARS-CoV2 infection from observed COVID-19 cases<c>Fall 2020 - Spring 2022-</c></span>
    <p>
      <em>Many Covid-19 infections remain underreported due to mildness of symptoms and/or inadequate testing.
      <a href="https://www.niddk.nih.gov/about-niddk/staff-directory/biography/chow-carson">Carson Chow’s lab</a> at the NIH
      along with <a href="https://sols.asu.edu/richard-gerkin">Rick Gerkin</a> of Arizona State University used Bayesian inference
      and a modified SIR model to predict the number of unreported infected individuals from reported cases, recoveries, and deaths.
      I joined the project to further develop <a href="https://github.com/nih-niddk-mbs/covid-sicr">the code base</a> and continue testing modeling 
      developments and public health advancements (vaccines, testing, etc). To showcase US state projections, I built an 
        <a href="https://aoschwartz.shinyapps.io/COVID-ShinyAnimated/">R Shiny app</a>.

<span>Identifying Snakes in Photos Using Machine Learning<c>July - November 2020</c></span>
  <p>
    <em>
      <a href="https://www.dickinson.edu/site/custom_scripts/dc_faculty_profile_index.php?fac=bobacks">Professor Scott Boback</a> of 
      Dickinson College studies patterns in rattlesnake basking activity among other interests.
      Using wildlife cameras focused on den entrances, he remotely collects images every 15 minutes from sunup to sundown
      in the spring and fall. Currently, analysis is quite cumbersome. Each photo is closely examined by eye to see if
      snakes are present. Some are snake-less. Then some reveal piles of camouflaged snakes. If the examiner spots one, they
      manually annotate it with a small yellow arrow. Finally, these annotations get compiled to track frequency counts
      and time of day measurements.

      I wrote <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1IyB_LPIuemESRE3MTp9nx4Y6qML2LXpSvUSIpuDFvHQ/edit">a collection of scripts</a> that use a custom object detection model for automating this process.
      Technology I used includes: YOLOv3, TensorFlow, Keras, LabelIMG, ImageAI. 
      Code for this project uses Google Colab for access to Google’s GPUs. The dataset for model training can be found
      <a href="https://github.com/aoschwartz7/ML_Snakes">here</a> on GitHub.

      <em>This <a href="https://github.com/aoschwartz7/LanguageQuiz">Python-Flask application</a>
        uses JSON representations of vocabulary dictionaries to help users learn a language via flashcards.
        The inspiration behind it came from living in Berlin, Germany, in the Fall of 2019 where I was taking
        language courses.
