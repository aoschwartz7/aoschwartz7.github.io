<span>Language Learner's Quiz<c>November-January 2020</c></span>
<p>
<em>This <a href="https://github.com/aoschwartz7/LanguageQuiz">Python-Flask application</a>
  uses JSON representations of vocabulary dictionaries to help users learn a language via flashcards.
  The inspiration behind it came from living in Berlin, Germany, in the Fall of 2019 where I was taking
  language courses. To access my Git repository for the game's files and for a more in depth walkthrough,
  click <a href="https://github.com/aoschwartz7/LanguageQuiz">here</a>.</em>
