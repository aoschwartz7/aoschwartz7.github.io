	<p>I started learning to code while I was working at a small Biotech/Pharma
		startup in the Boston area. The company was focused on developing drug-like
		small molecules to target a microRNA involved in breast cancer.
		(microRNAs are short, single-stranded RNA molecules that regulate
		gene expression.) I was hired to help wrap up an internal project that soon
		triggered our acquisition by UCB Pharmaceuticals. With two years of funding,
		our team got bigger and the pace ramped up. My research experience was
		ballooning, but I still didn't know how to go about automating data analysis.
		Sure, Microsoft Excel macros were helpful -- I could plug troves of
		data into analysis templates -- but there was too much room for human error.
		And it cost time. So I learned to code! I figured it could be helpful.

		I enrolled in a Python course on Codecademy and I started to really enjoy it.
		I liked the logic and problem solving it took to get tiny programs to run.
		Meanwhile, company deadlines were making work (and occasional evenings) even
		busier, so when there was some free time, I'd study at home. I tried making
		some small scripts for data analysis but didn't implement them at work at
		that point. We had contracted a company called Dotmatics to build out our
		electronic reports so I focused on helping to communicate our needs to the
		software engineers on their end. But I kept learning fundamental programming concepts
		and enrolled in more of Codecademy's courses (SQL and an intensive on data analysis).
		Work and deadlines quickly flew by. At the end of our two year benchmark, our
		company was ultimately denied further funding and we were all laid off. It
		was hard. But it was also a chance to do something new.

		Since then, I've kept up the EdX coursework and completed a Python-Flask web
		app project. I'm still quite green, but I'm definitely enjoying this new
		path so far. This site is where I plan to compile all my comp sci related work.

		Thanks for visiting!
