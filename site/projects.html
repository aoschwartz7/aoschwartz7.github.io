<span>Identifying Snakes in Photos Using Machine Learning<c>July -- November 2020</c></span>
  <p>
    <em>
      <a href="https://www.dickinson.edu/site/custom_scripts/dc_faculty_profile_index.php?fac=bobacks">Professor Scott Boback</a> of 
      Dickinson College studies patterns in rattlesnake basking activity among other interests.
      Using wildlife cameras focused on den entrances, he remotely collects images every 15 minutes from sunup to sundown
      in the spring and fall. Currently, analysis is quite cumbersome. Each photo is closely examined by eye to see if
      snakes are present. Some are snake-less. Then some reveal piles of camouflaged snakes. If the examiner spots one, they
      manually annotate it with a small, yellow arrow. Finally, these annotations get compiled to track frequency counts
      and time of day measurements.

      I built a pre-liminary platform for using a custom object detection model for automating this process.
      Technology I used includes: TensorFlow, Keras, LabelIMG, ImageAI, and the object detection system YOLOv3.
      Code for this project uses Google Colab for access to Google’s GPUs. The dataset for model training can be found
      <a href="https://github.com/aoschwartz7/ML_Snakes">here</a> on GitHub.

  <span>NIH NIDDK Covid-19 Open-source Contribution<c>July 2020</c></span>
    <p>
      <em>Many Covid-19 infections remain unreported due to mildness of symptoms and/or inadequate testing.
      <a href="https://www.niddk.nih.gov/about-niddk/staff-directory/biography/chow-carson">Carson Chow’s lab</a> at the NIH
      along with <a href="https://sols.asu.edu/richard-gerkin">Rick Gerkin</a> of Arizona State University are using Bayesian inference
      and a modified SIR model to predict the number of unreported infected individuals from reported cases, recoveries, and deaths.
      <a href="https://github.com/nih-niddk-mbs/covid-sicr">Their code</a> uses a suite of models of varying complexity to
      calculate these numbers for different regions,and then produces an average result across models for each region.
      For a preprint of their paper, click <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7239078/">here</a> .

      <em>My task was to produce an average result (mean deaths, cases, etc) for a user-defined super-region, like “Asia”,
        “Southern Asia”, or the United States. I familiarized myself with Pandas,
        using it to parse information on world countries into a format useful for the researchers’
        existing scripts. I then modified their <a href="https://github.com/nih-niddk-mbs/covid-sicr/pull/7">existing code</a>
        to include a parameter for selecting a super-region and extending the results to region-indexed tables.

  <span>Language Learner's Quiz<c>November-January 2020</c></span>
    <p>
      <em>This <a href="https://github.com/aoschwartz7/LanguageQuiz">Python-Flask application</a>
        uses JSON representations of vocabulary dictionaries to help users learn a language via flashcards.
        The inspiration behind it came from living in Berlin, Germany, in the Fall of 2019 where I was taking
        language courses. To access my Git repository for the game's files and for a more in depth walkthrough,
        click <a href="https://github.com/aoschwartz7/LanguageQuiz">here</a>.

    <p>
      <em>This <a href="https://github.com/aoschwartz7/Twilio">Python-Flask application</a> sends a user an SMS of a random riddle, listens for their response via a Twilio webhook,
      and sends either the answer or a new riddle. It was built using Flask architecture and <a href="https://www.twilio.com/docs/sms/tutorials/how-to-send-sms-messages-python">Twilio’s</a> Programmable SMS API and Python helper library.
