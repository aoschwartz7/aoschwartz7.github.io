	<p>After finishing college with a B.S. in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, 
	I worked as a research associate for a small Biotech company in Boston. 
	I was hired to help wrap up an internal project focused on drugging miRNAs 
	involved in breast cancer with small molecule compounds.
	Soon thereafter, we got acquired by UCB Pharmaceuticals, and my team became a spin-off 
	with two years of funding. <br><br>
	With more funding came more research. At times the amount of data my experiments were producing 
	became a bit overwhelming. So I started learning to code! 
	Iâ€™d make the data analysis a little more automated. And the new coursework became a lot of fun! 
	This site is now where my code-related work and CV live. <br><br>
