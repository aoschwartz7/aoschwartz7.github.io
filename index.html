Hi, I'm Alec Schwartz. I studied Biochemistry and Molecular Biology at Dickinson College, 
and then went on to work for a Boston area Biotech for several years. Swamped with drug-screening data, I began learning to how to code. 
This site is where all my coursework and projects live.

<em>I learned how to make this site using <a href="http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/">this great tutorial</a>.</em>
