<h4>Language Learner's Quiz</h4>
<p>
This <a href="https://github.com/aoschwartz7/LanguageQuiz">Python-Flask application</a>
  uses JSON representations of vocabulary dictionaries to help users learn a language via flashcards.
  The inspiration behind it came from living in Berlin, Germany, in the Fall of 2019 where I was taking
  language courses. To access my Git repository for the game's files and for a more in depth walkthrough,

<h4>Twilio Riddler</h4>
<p>
This <a href="https://github.com/aoschwartz7/Twilio">Python-Flask application</a> sends a user an SMS of a random riddle, listens for their response via a Twilio webhook,
and sends either the answer or a new riddle. It was built using Flask architecture and <a href="https://www.twilio.com/docs/sms/tutorials/how-to-send-sms-messages-python">Twilioâ€™s</a> Programmable SMS API and Python helper library.
