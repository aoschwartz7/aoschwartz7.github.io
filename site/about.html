	I started learning to code while I was working for a small
	Biotech/Pharma startup in the Boston area, eager to find ways to 
	automate data processing and analysis. I enrolled in Codecademy’s Python course
	and I started to really enjoy the logic it took to get tiny programs to run. 
	So I kept learning at home, enrolling in more courses (one in SQL, and another in data analysis). 
	At the end of the company’s two year funding cap, we were ultimately denied
	further funding and we were all laid off. It was at that point that I decided
	to take a risk and jump into what I’d been teaching myself at home for the
	past year. I moved to Berlin and later Barcelona and took German language courses while 
	taking a course in C and building a web application with the Python-Flask framework. Since 
	then, I've been adding HackerRank solutions and other coding problems to my site to keep 
	progressing. </p>
