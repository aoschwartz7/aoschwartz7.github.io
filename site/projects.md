### Language Learner's Quiz
This [Python-Flask application](https://github.com/aoschwartz7/LanguageQuiz) uses JSON representations of vocabulary dictionaries to help users learn a language via flashcards. The inspiration behind it came from living in Berlin, Germany, in the Fall of 2019 where I was taking language courses.
