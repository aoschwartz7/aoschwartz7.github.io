	I started learning to code while I was working for a small
	Biotech startup in the Boston area, motivated by the limitations I encountered
	in Excel’s data processing functions. I enrolled in Codecademy’s Python course
	and I started to really enjoy the logic it took to get tiny programs to run. I
	tried writing some small scripts for analysis but didn't apply them then—our
	experiments and data formats were always changing. So I kept learning at home,
	enrolling in more courses (one on SQL, and another on data analysis).
	At the end of the company’s two year funding cap, we were ultimately denied
	further funding and we were all laid off. It was at this point that I decided
	to take a risk and jump into what I’d been teaching myself at home for the
	past year. </p>

	Since then, I've written programs with Python and C, and 
	built a web application with the Flask framework.
	Striving now to build useful, creative programs
	hasn’t just become a fun challenge; it’s showing me how programming can apply
	to virtually every field—areas spanning well beyond biology research and drug
	discovery. Now I'm looking for a job where I can continue to
	develop these skills.</p>
