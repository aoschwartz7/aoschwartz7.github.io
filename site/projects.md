## Language Learner's Quiz
This Python-Flask application uses a JSON representation of German to English and German to Spanish dictionaries to help users learn more introductory German/English/Spanish vocabulary. The inspiration behind it came out of necessity at first. I spent 4 months living in Berlin and studying German in 2019, and another few months in Barcelona in early 2020. I was eager to learn more vocab and figured this would be a fun way to combine two main goals: learn Deutsch and learn how to make a Python-Flask application.
