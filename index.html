	<h2>Welcome to my page!</h2>
	<p>After finishing college with a B.S. in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, 
	I worked as a research associate for a small Biotech company in Boston. 
	I was hired to help wrap up an internal project focused on drugging miRNAs 
	involved in breast cancer with small molecule compounds. /
	Soon thereafter, we got acquired by UCB Pharmaceuticals, and my team became a spin-off startup 
	with two years of funding. <br>
	With more funding came more research. At times the amount of data my experiments were producing 
	became a bit overwhelming. So I started learning to code! 
	Iâ€™d make the data analysis a little more automated. And the new coursework became a lot of fun! 
	This site is now where my code-related work and CV live. <br>
