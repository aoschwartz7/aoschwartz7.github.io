	<p>I started learning to code while I was working for a small Biotech startup
		in the Boston area, motivated by the limitations Excel Macros have for
		processing troves of data. I enrolled in Codecademy’s Python course and I
		started to really enjoy the logic it took to get tiny programs to run.
		I tried writing some small scripts for analysis but didn't apply them
		then—our experiments and data formats were constantly changing. So I kept
		learning the fundamentals at home, enrolling in more Codecademy courses
		(one on SQL, and another an intensive on data analysis). Work and deadlines
		flew by. At the end of our two year benchmark, we were ultimately denied
		further funding and we were all laid off. It was hard, but also a chance
		to do something new.</p>
		<p>Looking back, being more computer savvy for handling data would have been
		immensely useful at my job. I knew that then, too. Striving now to build
		useful, elegant, and creative programs hasn’t just become a fun challenge;
		it’s showing me how programming can apply to virtually every field—areas
		spanning well beyond biology research and drug discovery. Since then, I've
		maintained the EdX coursework and built a web application using a
		Python-Flask framework for more practice. Now I'm looking for a job that'll
		help me continue developing these skills.</p>
